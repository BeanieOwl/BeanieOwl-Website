    <p>When you install the App, we may access and store the following information from your Shopify store:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Inventory events related to products going out of stock or being restocked</li>
      <li>Order data required to calculate sales averages (such as order timestamps and quantities)</li>
      <li>Store metadata (such as store name, Shopify plan, and currency)</li>
      <li>App usage information for billing, analytics, and support purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect customer personal data such as names, email addresses, payment details, or shipping addresses.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Track out-of-stock events and calculate their duration</li>
      <li>Display inventory availability insights within the App dashboard</li>
      <li>Generate reports and CSV exports requested by the merchant</li>
      <li>Maintain App functionality, performance, and billing</li>
      <li>Provide support and respond to merchant inquiries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell or share your data with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We store data securely and restrict access to authorised systems and personnel. We take reasonable technical and organisational measures designed to protect your data against unauthorised access, loss, misuse, or alteration.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain store data only for as long as your store has the App installed, or as needed to provide the App’s functionality. You may request deletion of your store’s data at any time by contacting us.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App integrates with Shopify’s APIs and complies with Shopify’s API Terms and data protection requirements. We do not provide your store data to additional third-party services unless required to operate the App.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your store’s data by contacting us. If you uninstall the App, we will delete your store’s data within a reasonable timeframe unless retention is required for legal, accounting, or dispute resolution purposes.</p>
