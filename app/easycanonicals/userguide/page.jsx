        <strong>Warning:</strong> When managing wildcard links, it&apos;s easy to inadvertently harm your SEO by applying blanket rules (e.g., using <code>contains &quot;/collections&quot;</code>). Please use wildcard management carefully to avoid unintended consequences.

        <h2>What Does This Do?</h2>
        <p>
          When multiple URLs lead to similar or duplicate content, Google isn&apos;t always sure 
          which page to display in search results. This confusion can dilute your SEO efforts by 
          splitting ranking signals across multiple pages and cause search engines to crawl the 
          same information more than necessary. Easy Canonicals solves this problem by letting 
          you pick the single page you want to prioritize, consolidating your SEO value and 
          ensuring customers find the correct page in search results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Easy Canonicals helps you tell search engines which page to show in search
          results when you have similar or duplicate pages. This can improve your
          store&apos;s search rankings and make sure customers find the right pages.
        </p>
        <p>2 Options to creating canonical links:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Exact Links:</strong> Pick a specific page to prioritize.</li>
          <li><strong>Wildcard Rules:</strong> Set one rule to handle multiple similar pages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Performance and Canonical Tag Management</h2>

        <h3>Does the Script Slow Down My Website?</h3>
        <p>
          Great question! Our app uses a lightweight script that loads asynchronously. This means it doesn&apos;t block the main thread or delay your page from rendering while it fetches and applies canonical links. As a result, it won&apos;t impact your store&apos;s loading speed or your customers&apos; browsing experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the script is optimized to perform only necessary operations, ensuring that your website remains fast and responsive.
        </p>

        <h3>How Does the App Manage Canonical Tags?</h3>
        <p>
          Shopify doesn&apos;t allow developers to directly modify HTTP headers, which is one way to set canonical tags (e.g., <code>Link: &lt;URL&gt;; rel="canonical"</code>). Instead, our app overrides Shopify&apos;s default self-referencing canonical tags by injecting the correct canonical tags directly into the HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          This method is fully compatible with Shopifyâ€™s platform and provides the same SEO benefits as setting canonical tags via HTTP headers. By managing canonical tags within the HTML, we ensure that search engines accurately recognize your preferred URLs without compromising your store&apos;s performance.

        <h2>How Do I Use This?</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Get Started</h3>
        <p>When you open the app, you&apos;ll see two options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Manage Exact Links:</strong> Set a priority page for specific URLs.</li>
          <li><strong>Manage Wildcard Links:</strong> Set a rule to handle groups of similar pages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click on the option that works for you!</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Managing Exact Links</h3>
        <p>Use this if you want to tell search engines to prioritize one specific page over another.</p>
        <p><strong>When to Use:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When two or more pages on your site have the same or similar content, and you
            want search engines to focus on one specific page.
          </li>
          <li>For example, you have a product available in two categories:</li>
        </ul>
        <p style={{ fontStyle: 'italic' }}>
          Example: <br />
          URL 1: <code>https://yourstore.com/collections/summer/products/blue-shirt</code> <br />
          URL 2: <code>https://yourstore.com/collections/sale/products/blue-shirt</code> <br />
          Use an Exact Link to tell search engines to prioritize: <br />
          <code>https://yourstore.com/products/blue-shirt</code>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>How To Add a Link:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Click <strong>&quot;Create Single Canonical Link.&quot;</strong></li>
          <img
            src="/images/SingleLink_Highlight.png"
            alt="Wildcard Example Highlight"
            style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', margin: '10px 0' }}
          />
          <li>
            Enter:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>URL Path:</strong> The part of the URL after your store&apos;s domain.
                Example: <code>/collections/summer/products/blue-shirt</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Canonical URL:</strong> The full URL of the page you want search
                engines to focus on. Example: <code>https://yourstore.com/products/blue-shirt</code>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Check that your saved link appears in the table below; if it&apos;s there, that
              means it&apos;s active and the canonical link will be in the header for the
              specific page path.
            </strong>
          </li>
          <img
            src="/images/Single_Saved_example.png"
            alt="Wildcard Example Highlight"
            style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', margin: '10px 0' }}
          />
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Managing Wildcard Links</h3>
        <p>
          Use this when you have many similar pages (like <code>/collections/summer</code>)
          and want to set one rule for all of them.
        </p>
        <p><strong>When to Use:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When multiple pages share a common structure or pattern, and you want search
            engines to prioritize one primary URL.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, you run seasonal collections and want to point them to a single page:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style={{ fontStyle: 'italic' }}>
          Example: <br />
          Match all pages starting with: <code>/collections/summer</code>. <br />
          Prioritize the canonical URL: <code>https://yourstore.com/collections/summer</code>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>How To Add a Wildcard Link:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Click <strong>&quot;Create Wildcard Canonical Link.&quot;</strong></li>

            alt="Wildcard Example Highlight"
            style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', margin: '10px 0' }}
          />
          <li>
            Choose how to match your pages:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Contains:</strong> Match all pages with a word or phrase in the URL
                (e.g., &quot;summer&quot;).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Starts With:</strong> Match all pages starting with a phrase
                (e.g., <code>/collections/summer</code>).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ends With:</strong> Match all pages ending with a phrase
                (e.g., &quot;-sale&quot;).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Enter:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Pattern:</strong> The part of the URL you want to match.
                Example: <code>/collections/summer</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Canonical URL:</strong> The full URL you want search engines to focus on.

        <h2>FAQs</h2>

        <h3>Why Should I Use This?</h3>
        <p>
          - Prevent duplicate content: If you have similar pages, this tool helps search
          engines know which one to show.
          <br />- Improve rankings: By focusing traffic on a single page, you get better
          visibility.
        </p>

        <h3>What&apos;s the Difference Between Exact and Wildcard Links?</h3>
        <p>
          The difference lies in how they handle your pages and when you should use them:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Exact Links:</strong> Use these when you want to specify a canonical URL for a
            single, specific page. This is perfect for situations where two or more pages have
            similar or duplicate content, and you want search engines to focus on one exact URL.
            For example:
            <ul>
              <li>
                You have two URLs pointing to the same product:
                <br />
                <code>https://yourstore.com/collections/summer/products/blue-shirt</code>
                <br />
                <code>https://yourstore.com/collections/sale/products/blue-shirt</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                You can create an Exact Link to tell search engines to prioritize:
                <br />
                <code>https://yourstore.com/products/blue-shirt</code>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wildcard Links:</strong> Use these when you have a group of pages with a
            shared pattern or structure and want to set a rule for all of them. This is ideal
            for handling many similar pages efficiently. For example:
            <ul>
              <li>
                You run seasonal collections, and all URLs start with the same pattern:
                <code>/collections/summer</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Instead of setting a canonical URL for each page individually, you can create a
                Wildcard Link that matches all pages starting with <code>/collections/summer</code>
                and point them to:
                <br />
                <code>https://yourstore.com/collections/summer</code>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In short:
          <br />
          - Use <strong>Exact Links</strong> for individual pages when precision matters.
          <br />
          - Use <strong>Wildcard Links</strong> for groups of similar pages to save time and
          streamline management.

        <h3>What Happens If I Mess Up?</h3>
        <p>Don&apos;t worry! You can always edit or delete any links you&apos;ve added.</p>

        <h3>How Do I Know It&apos;s Working?</h3>
        <p>
          You can check if your canonical links are working by using one of these methods:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Inspect the Page Source:</strong> Right-click on the page and select
            <em> View Page Source</em>. Look for the <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot;&gt;</code> tag
            in the header section. It should contain the canonical URL you specified.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use Browser Developer Tools:</strong> Open your browser&apos;s developer
            tools (usually by pressing <code>F12</code> or <code>Ctrl+Shift+I</code>). Go to the
            <em>Elements</em> or <em>Network</em> tab, and check the header for the
            <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot;&gt;</code> tag.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use Online Tools:</strong> Tools like{' '}

          </li>
        </ul>
